<h3>Chase Atlantic by Chase Atlantic</h3>
<p>
    Chase Atlantic, just like Ferite, is very diverse. It is an album you will never get sick of. I have been listening to this album since 2020, and I fall in love with it every single time I listen to it. It is simply timeless.

<h3>Épico by Lunay</h3>
<p>
    Épico is Lunay's first full-length album. It has one of my favorite songs by him, "360". By now, you might have guessed, but this album is also very diverse. It is a blend of reggaeton, Latin trap, and Latin pop. It is simply a very upbeat and fun album. which is perfect for the summer.
